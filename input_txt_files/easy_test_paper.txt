transaction confirmation time is from 10 to 16 times faster than that of bitcoin, depending on the
adversarial hashing power; for general adversaries confirmation time is from 5 to 10 times faster.
Moreover, our concrete analysis of double-spending attacks relies on our combinatorial analysis of
forkable and covertly forkable strings and applies to a much broader class of adversarial behavior
