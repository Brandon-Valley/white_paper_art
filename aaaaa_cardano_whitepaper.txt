Abstract
We present “Ouroboros”, the first blockchain protocol based on proof of stake with rigorous security guarantees. We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to
those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a “proof of stake”
blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof
of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing Proof of Stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior
is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining. We also
present initial evidence of the practicality of our protocol in real world settings by providing
experimental results on transaction confirmation and processing.
1 Introduction
A primary consideration regarding the operation of blockchain protocols based on proof of work
(PoW)—such as bitcoin [30]—is the energy required for their execution. At the time of this writing, generating a single block on the bitcoin blockchain requires a number of hashing operations
exceeding 260, which results in striking energy demands. Indeed, early calculations indicated that
the energy requirements of the protocol were comparable to that of a small country [32].
This state of affairs has motivated the investigation of alternative blockchain protocols that
would obviate the need for proof of work by substituting it with another, more energy efficient,
mechanism that can provide similar guarantees. It is important to point out that the proof of work
mechanism of bitcoin facilitates a type of randomized “leader election” process that elects one of
the miners to issue the next block. Furthermore, provided that all miners follow the protocol, this
