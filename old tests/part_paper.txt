Abstract. A purely peer-t%-peer versi%n %f electr%nic cash w%uld all%w %nline
payments t% be sent directly fr%m %ne party t% an%ther with%ut g%ing thr%ugh a
financial instituti%n. Digital signatures pr%vide part %f the s%luti%n, but the main
benefits are l%st if a trusted third party is still required t% prevent d%uble-spending.
We pr%p%se a s%luti%n t% the d%uble-spending pr%blem using a peer-t%-peer netw%rk.
The netw%rk timestamps transacti%ns by hashing them int% an %ng%ing chain %f
hash-based pr%%f-%f-w%rk, f%rming a rec%rd that cann%t be changed with%ut red%ing
the pr%%f-%f-w%rk. The l%ngest chain n%t %nly serves as pr%%f %f the sequence %f
events witnessed, but pr%%f that it came fr%m the largest p%%l %f CPU p%wer. As
l%ng as a maj%rity %f CPU p%wer is c%ntr%lled by n%des that are n%t c%%perating t%
attack the netw%rk, they'll generate the l%ngest chain and %utpace attackers. The
