The Stellar Consensus Protocol:
A Federated Model for Internet-level Consensus
DAVID MAZIERES ` , Stellar Development Foundation
This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves
robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine
system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit decisions now unify the Internet.
We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine
agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake
schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially opening up financial systems to new participants.

1. INTRODUCTION
Financial infrastructure is currently a mess of closed systems. Gaps between these
systems mean that transaction costs are high [Provost 2013] and money moves slowly
across political and geographic boundaries [Banning-Lover 2015; CGAP 2008]. This
friction has curtailed the growth of financial services, leaving billions of people underserved financially [Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2015].
To solve these problems, we need financial infrastructure that supports the kind of
organic growth and innovation we’ve seen from the Internet, yet still ensures the integrity of financial transactions. Historically, we have relied on high barriers to entry to
ensure integrity. We trust established financial institutions and do our best to regulate
them. But this exclusivity conflicts with the goal of organic growth. Growth demands
new, innovative participants, who may possess only modest financial and computing
resources.
We need a worldwide financial network open to anyone, so that new organizations
can join and extend financial access to unserved communities. The challenge for such
a network is ensuring participants record transactions correctly. With a low barrier
to entry, users won’t trust providers to police themselves. With worldwide reach,
providers won’t all trust a single entity to operate the network. A compelling alternative is a decentralized system in which participants together ensure integrity by
agreeing on the validity of one another’s transactions. Such agreement hinges on a
mechanism for worldwide consensus.
This paper presents federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), a model suitable for
worldwide consensus. In FBA, each participant knows of others it considers important. It waits for the vast majority of those others to agree on any transaction before
considering the transaction settled. In turn, those important participants do not agree
to the transaction until the participants they consider important agree as well, and so
on. Eventually, enough of the network accepts a transaction that it becomes infeasible
for an attacker to roll it back. Only then do any participants consider the transaction
settled. FBA’s consensus can ensure the integrity of a financial network. Its decentralized control can spur organic growth.
This paper further presents the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), a construction for
FBA. We prove that SCP’s safety is optimal for an asynchronous protocol, in that it
guarantees agreement under any node-failure scenario that admits such a guarantee.The Stellar Consensus Protocol:

A Federated Model for Internet-level Consensus
DAVID MAZIERES ` , Stellar Development Foundation
This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves
robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine
system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit decisions now unify the Internet.
We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine
agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake
schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially opening up financial systems to new participants.

1. INTRODUCTION
Financial infrastructure is currently a mess of closed systems. Gaps between these
systems mean that transaction costs are high [Provost 2013] and money moves slowly
across political and geographic boundaries [Banning-Lover 2015; CGAP 2008]. This
friction has curtailed the growth of financial services, leaving billions of people underserved financially [Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2015].
To solve these problems, we need financial infrastructure that supports the kind of
organic growth and innovation we’ve seen from the Internet, yet still ensures the integrity of financial transactions. Historically, we have relied on high barriers to entry to
ensure integrity. We trust established financial institutions and do our best to regulate
them. But this exclusivity conflicts with the goal of organic growth. Growth demands
new, innovative participants, who may possess only modest financial and computing
resources.
We need a worldwide financial network open to anyone, so that new organizations
can join and extend financial access to unserved communities. The challenge for such
a network is ensuring participants record transactions correctly. With a low barrier
to entry, users won’t trust providers to police themselves. With worldwide reach,
providers won’t all trust a single entity to operate the network. A compelling alternative is a decentralized system in which participants together ensure integrity by
agreeing on the validity of one another’s transactions. Such agreement hinges on a
mechanism for worldwide consensus.

can join and extend financial access to unserved communities. The challenge for such
a network is ensuring participants record transactions correctly. With a low barrier
to entry, users won’t trust providers to police themselves. With worldwide reach,
providers won’t all trust a single entity to operate the network. A compelling alternative is a decentralized system in which participants together ensure integrity by
agreeing on the validity of one another’s transactions. Such agreement hinges on a
mechanism for worldwide consensus.
This paper presents federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), a model suitable for
worldwide consensus. In FBA, each participant knows of others it considers important. It waits for the vast majority of those others to agree on any transaction before
considering the transaction settled. In turn, those important participants do not agree
to the transaction until the participants they consider important agree as well, and so
on. Eventually, enough of the network accepts a transaction that it becomes infeasible
for an attacker to roll it back. Only then do any participants consider the transaction
settled. FBA’s consensus can ensure the integrity of a financial network. Its decentralized control can spur organic growth.
This paper further presents the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), a construction for
FBA. We prove that SCP’s safety is optimal for an asynchronous protocol, in that it
guarantees agreement under any node-failure scenario that admits such a guarantee.The Stellar Consensus Protocol:
A Federated Model for Internet-level Consensus
DAVID MAZIERES ` , Stellar Development Foundation
This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves
robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine
system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit decisions now unify the Internet.
We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine
agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake
schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially opening up financial systems to new participants.

1. INTRODUCTION
Financial infrastructure is currently a mess of closed systems. Gaps between these
systems mean that transaction costs are high [Provost 2013] and money moves slowly
across political and geographic boundaries [Banning-Lover 2015; CGAP 2008]. This
friction has curtailed the growth of financial services, leaving billions of people underserved financially [Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2015].
To solve these problems, we need financial infrastructure that supports the kind of
organic growth and innovation we’ve seen from the Internet, yet still ensures the integrity of financial transactions. Historically, we have relied on high barriers to entry to
ensure integrity. We trust established financial institutions and do our best to regulate
them. But this exclusivity conflicts with the goal of organic growth. Growth demands
